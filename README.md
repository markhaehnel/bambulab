bambulab is a async Rust crate that provides a channel based client for interacting with Bambu Lab devices over their MQTT broker.

## Features

- Subscribe to printer messages like print progress, temperatures, errors, etc.
- Publish commands to the printer
- Support for P1P, P1S and X1C printer

## Usage

First, add `bambulab` to your dependencies:
```bash
cargo add bambulab
```

Then, use the `Client` struct to create a new client and connect to a printer:

```rust
use bambulab::{client::Client, command::Command};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let host = "printer-ip-or-hostname";
    let access_code = "printer-access-code";
    let serial = "printer-serial-number";

    let (tx, mut rx) = tokio::sync::broadcast::channel::<Message>(25);

    let mut client = Client::new(host, access_code, serial, tx);

    tokio::try_join!(
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            client.run().await.unwrap();
        }),
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            loop {
                let message = rx.recv().await.unwrap();
                println!("received: {message:?}");
            }
        })
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Please note that you need to call subscribe() to allow the API to listen to messages.

More examples available in the [examples](./examples) directory.

## FAQ

### How do I find the access code?

You can find the access code in the printer settings under "WLAN" -> "Access Code".

### How do I find the serial number?

The serial can be found in the printer settings under "SN".
