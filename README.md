ðŸš§ **WORK IN PROGRESS** ðŸš§

bambulab is a asnyc Rust crate that provides an client for interacting with Bambu Lab devices.

## Features

- Subscribe to printer messages like print progress, temperatures, errors, etc.
- Publish commands to the printer
- Support for P1P, P1S and X1C printer

## Usage

First, add `bambulab` to your dependencies:
```bash
cargo add bambulab
```

Then, use the `Client` struct to create a new client and connect to a printer:

```rust
use bambulab::{client::Client, command::Command};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
  let host = "printer-ip-or-hostname";
  let access_code = "printer-access-code";
  let serial = "printer-serial-number";

  let mut client = Client::new(host, access_code, serial);

  client.connect().await?;

  client.publish(Command::PushAll).await?;

  loop {
    let message = client.poll().await?;
    println!("{message:?}");
  }
}
```

Please note that you need to call subscribe() to allow the API to listen to messages.

More examples available in the [examples](./../examples) directory.
